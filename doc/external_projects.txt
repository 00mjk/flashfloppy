External projects which may be of use to FlashFloppy (or are already
integrated into FlashFloppy):

FatFS:     FAT Filesystem
           1-clause BSD license

STSW-STM32046: F105/7, F2, F4 USB OTG Host & Device Library
           ST Liberty v2 license
           Allows to make copies and prepare derivative copies
           of the source code. Derivative work must only run
           on STM32 devices (not really a problem). Overall,
           just about permissive enough and not many other
           open USB libraries to choose from!

STSW-STM32121: F10x, L1, F3 USB FS Device Library
           ST Liberty v2 license (see above)
